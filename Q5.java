// 5. Redo question 2 in a Hash format, can you make it? Do you think that itâ€™s a good idea?
// No. Not a good idea, because the hashmap is unordered and does not define order of iteration. 
// Swapping the position of two pairs in a hashmap is not possible 
// as there is no defined order to swap their positions in.


// public class Q5 {
    
//           // Either use a LinkedHashMap, or the default Hashmap, which uh, can't work.
// }
